This logo will ensure high standards of second hand products to encourage the use of recycling textiles and limit environmental damage caused by the textile industry. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recycled by</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will encourage organisations, businesses and groups to see textile recycling as a movement they are proud to be a part of. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recycled by</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> network will enable businesses to work together to empower and support each other in taking their first steps towards recycling within their organisation. We understand that bringing in sustainable, recycling practices can be a challenge, so </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recycled by</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to bring organisations together, to mutually support and encourage one another.</span></p><p><strong>Who we want to work with</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to work with organisations who are starting to think about being involved in the sustainable economy. This could be small independent organisations who feel marginalised or dwarfed by larger scale organisations - we want to help you feel encouraged to begin taking sustainable steps within your business. Or if you are an organisation that hasn’t joined the sustainable movement yet, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recycled by</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the network we create will guide you through your ‘green’ actions.

The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recycled by </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">logo communicates that you want customers to be proud of wearing and using recycled products. We want to protect use of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recycled by </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">logo for high quality initiatives that show recycling is the best option over buying new when it comes to sustainability. We appreciate that consumers are now more supportive than ever of the recycled industry and demand for recycled clothes is increasing. Since 2018, second hand sales have increased by 404% year on year.
